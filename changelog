v3.6
Fixed bugs:
1. When using mitoz visualize `--depth_file`, there is no depth track in the resulting image (https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/issues/183)
2. https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/issues/185
3. shell problem and misuse of Mac OS cmsearch for Linux platform: https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/issues/187
4. added tiara support to quickly identify mt contigs.
5. fixed some bugs, fastq data sampling, file path problems.

v3.5
Fixed bugs:
1. Fixed the dependency problem of 'mitoz-tools': html5lib
2. Fixed the sub-sampling bug (it was 10 times than expected)
3. Fixed the bug on https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/issues/154 and https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/issues/24#issuecomment-572884734.
4. https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/issues/177
5. https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/issues/176

New features:
1. Should now also run on Mac OS (M1 and Intel chips); but the assembler SPAdes won't work on Mac OS due to https://github.com/ablab/spades/issues/873 and lack of proper version for Mac OS. However, you can download it from https://cab.spbu.ru/files/release3.15.4/SPAdes-3.15.4-Darwin.tar.gz and put it into the mitozEnv environment (or PATH variable). The assembler mitoassembler also does not work on Mac OS yet. NB: it could be very tricky to install the Circos problem on Mac OS; you might want to install Circos by following http://circos.ca/tutorials/lessons/configuration/perl_and_modules/.

2. Added a few tools to the 'mitoz-tools' command, see https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/wiki/Overview%3A-The-%27mitoz-tools%27-command.

3. Users can now use their own sqn template file ('--template_sbt'):

v3.4
1. fixed three bugs: 
- https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/issues/30
- https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/issues/149
- https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/issues/150 


v3.3
1. optimize the abundance calculation workflow in the 'findmitoscaf' function.
2. add spades and megahit for mitogenome assembly
3. If mitoassemble/spades/megahit have finished previous runs, we will just skip
them to save time.
4. fix a potential bug: a genus could belong to non-Metazoa


v3.2
1. Fixed a bug in 'filter_taxonomy_by_CDS_annotation.py', which did not parse the
genetic code to the command correctly (always parsed 5 for all input genetic
codes).

2. '--requiring_taxa' becomes necessary option, in case the users set '--clade
Chordata' but forget to set this option (because its default was
'Arthropoda').

3. Now the 'overlapping' information is copied to the resulting folder
automatically.

4. The circularity information now is parsed to the annotation module correctly.

5. The length of sequence ids now are checked before running annotation.

6. Seems that the problem which in some cases circos not drawing SVG/PNG files is fixed.

7. For the dependency pakcage 'ete3', now we change it to v3.1.2, this shoulf fix the NCBITaxa() problem when creating or updating the database.

v3.1
add the seqkit program to subsample clean data for mitochondrial assembly,
so the users don't have to do it by themselves.


v3.0

tested on one UCE sample (SRR8885027), got circular mitogenome.
use fastp to filter.
now multiple kmers can be specified by users directly

v2.3
20180123
1. describe the most-closely-related species in the 'summary.txt' file
2. describe the topology of each sequence in the 'summary.txt' file
3. provide an example config file for each module in the program direcotry.
4, make `all` and `filter` support single-end data
5. now can also annotate control region.

v2.2
20180114
1. add configure file support

v2.1
20180110
1. add single-end data support

v2.0
20180104
1. remove the useless codes
2. to be more user-friendly

v1.0
20181121
1. use conda to install blastn and other programs, MitoZ uses those command from the PATH variable
